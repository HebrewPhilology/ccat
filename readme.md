# CCAT clone repository
This repository is a clone of the **[Center for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT)](https://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/)** repository at the University of Pennsylvania. Some typos in the ccat repository have been corrected.

The goal of the project is to preserve this valuable data in a more conventional and modern format for users, and to provide conversion tools for computational purposes.

The `src' folder contains:
- the python script to clone the "html repositories"
- a script to convert the parallel folder in betacode to unicode and the text files to JSON files, which are more convenient for computation.
