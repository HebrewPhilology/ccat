Most of the older files here were created before Hebrew and Greek 
fonts were widely available.  Therefore they use a system of 
transliteration called Beta Code. The following page shows how to 
read Beta Code:
http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/0-betacode.txt

There are some fonts that use the same characters as beta code.  You can 
get them here:

For example, if you put Greek into SPIonic, you'll see Greek, more or less. 
This doesn't work so well for Hebrew, because the direction of writing is 
reversed. 

At this point, most people are using our data as formatted by companies 
that have put them into convenient fonts.  However, for people who like 
to "roll their own", we do have some old programs that might work on 
your system.  For example, for MacOS 9
	http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/other/software/mac/transcribe/
and for DOS:
	http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/other/software/dos/ccatutil/

Some new files use unicode and should display Hebrew and Greek in 
any browser and system that uses unicode. 

If you just want the Greek and Hebrew biblical texts, try these sites in 
a web browser that understands unicode (for example, Firefox):
